## Error Handling

Error handling in BSM ensures smooth user interaction and efficient debugging. All errors follow a unified response structure for consistency.

#### Generic Error Template

```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "statusCode": 404,
      "message": "A brief error message explaining what went wrong",
      "error": {"Detailed error object or message"},
      "stack": "Error stack trace (for development mode)"
    }
```

## Environment Variables

All necessary environment variable names are provided in the `.env.example` file. This file serves as a reference to configure your local or production environment. Ensure you create a `.env` file in your project root and populate it with the correct values.

Example variables include:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the database.
- `PORT`: Port number for the server.

For a full list of environment variables, check the `.env.example` file in the project root.
